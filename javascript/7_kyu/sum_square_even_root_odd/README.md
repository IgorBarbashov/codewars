Complete the function that takes a list of numbers (`nums`), as the only argument to the function. Take each number in the list and _square_ it if it is even, or _square root_ the number if it is odd. Take this new list and return the _sum_ of it, rounded to two decimal places.

The list will never be empty and will only contain values that are greater than or equal to zero.
