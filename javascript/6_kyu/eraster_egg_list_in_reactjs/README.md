You decide to create a simple list of your favourite Easter eggs in React.

**Challenge**
_Learn about nesting and listing React components._

- The component `EggList` will set a prop called eggs which is an array of your favourite Easter eggs e.g. "Lindt"
- Loop through the `props.eggs` to output an unordered list of Easter eggs
- Each list item should be a component called `EasterEgg` with a prop `name`, to render the name in a `li` tag
- Each `EasterEgg` will need a `key` prop with a unique id. Use the index of the array for now.
